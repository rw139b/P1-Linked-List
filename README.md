## Known Bugs or Issues

There are no issues that I have ran into in both regular tests and stress testing.

## Experience

This was a great experince, I was able to have AI write 100% of all of the code for p2, I used my linked list from p1 which I worte most of with AI assistance but between ChatGPT and Claude free usage, nothing I wrote for the threading. Hoping I can get those bonus points ;). I have the saved chats if you would like to verify as well.
