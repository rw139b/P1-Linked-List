## Known Bugs or Issues

There are no issues but I was unable to reach those edge cases for 100% coverage but I belive it has to do with malloc.

## Experience

Understanding the correct pointer manipulation for a circular, doubly linked list with a sentinel node. Off-by-one errors and forgetting to update both next and prev links caused tricky bugs at first.
Achieving near-100% code coverage required thinking carefully about edge cases, like NULL lists and out-of-bounds indices.
